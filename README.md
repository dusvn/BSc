Data Preparation notebook contains full process of data collecting and preparation which enables us to training neural network on efficient way.<br>
Neural network notebook describes process of developing neural network model.<br>
Full source code you can find in directory project.<br>
<li>Front - this directory contains source code of simple UI which you can see in this readme.</li>
<li>Service - inside this directory you can find Web API for prediction. Web API is developed inside Microsoft Service Fabric(Platform as a Service).</li>
Requirements:
<li>Service Fabric SDK</li>
<li>Python version >=3.12</li>
